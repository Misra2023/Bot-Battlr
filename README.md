# GET STARTED

# BOT BATTLR
Welcome to Bot Battlr, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army!

Here's the scenario: a galactic overlord has hired you, a galactic web developer, to develop a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through alist of robots,views of robots details and enlist of a bot into the army

project setup
1.Run this command to get the backend started: npx json-server --watch db.json --port 8002 2.In a new terminal, run npm start. This will run your React app in a new port.

# ENDpOINTS
The base URL for the backend is: http://localhost:3003/

deliverables
we should be able to :
See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection. Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection. Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component. Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.
